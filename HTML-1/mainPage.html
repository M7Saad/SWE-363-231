    <h1>Why Don't We Consider Problem Solving as a Habit (or maybe hobby)?</h1>

    <p>
      Why don't we consider problem solving as a habit or hobby? It's an
      everyday skill we use, from navigating daily challenges to deciphering
      puzzles. Embracing problem solving as a regular practice can not only
      boost our cognitive abilities but also provide a source of enjoyment in
      the process. So, perhaps it's time we make problem solving a deliberate
      habit or even a hobby, appreciating the satisfaction it brings when we
      find solutions to life's puzzles.
