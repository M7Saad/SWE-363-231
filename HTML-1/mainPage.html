          Why don't we consider problem solving as a habit or hobby? It's an
          everyday skill we use, from navigating daily challenges to deciphering
          puzzles. Embracing problem solving as a regular practice can not only
          boost our cognitive abilities but also provide a source of enjoyment
          in the process. So, perhaps it's time we make problem solving a
          deliberate habit or even a hobby, appreciating the satisfaction it
          brings when we find solutions to life's puzzles.
